## Self-reflection notes

To me:

- Can I plan better than last week, to break everything down to managable tasks?
- Can I get better commit messages?
-

For Joe:

1.  What was the best way to select my image containers from the DOM? Using querySelector, or getElementById, or something else?
2.  How can I tell if a for loop or a forEach loop would suit me better in this circumstance?
3.  How should I have finished the end of the thumbnail function?
    thumbnailImage.addEventListener("onclick", function () {
    createFullscreenImage(img);
    });
    }
4.  I didn't get on well trying to draw my wireframe online, I did a paper and pencil and haven't managed to get an image on here, but it was similar to Manny's. I have included my written out plan instead in /assets/screenshots folder
